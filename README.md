# Reiberdiagram

The Reiberdiagram was invented by Hansotto Reiber to visualize reasons for unusual high concentrations of proteins
in the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This may be due to problems with the blood brain barrier or antibody
synthesis in the CSF. The diagram consist of two main curves enclosing the normal range, some additional curves
labelled 20%, 40% etc., an age-dependent vertical seperation line and a mark that highlights the position of the 
current measurement. The x-axis is the albumin quotient and the y-axis the immunoglobulin quotient.
